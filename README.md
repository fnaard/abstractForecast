abstractForecast
================

This is a Processing (processing.org) sketch that fetches the current weather forecast, from Yahoo, for a (hard-coded) location, then displays it in an abstract twenty-by-four grid of colored squares.

Currently, the sketch draws patterns based simply on the "human readable" form of the weather forecast, such as "cloudy," or "light drizzle."  Using that code as an example, though, it should be simple to draw an abstract pattern that represents, e.g, temperature, humidity, moon phase, locust swarms..

This repository includes a minified version of the HYPE library, so you don't need to have the HYPE library installed in your environment.  Up-to-date versions of the HYPE library, in its entirety, can be fetched from https://github.com/hype/HYPE_Processing
